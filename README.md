Pong!
---

Recreation of the classic game **pong** in python! <br/>
I finished it in like an hour.. so don't expect it to be polished in any way.

Play with your friend! play with AI! Do whatever you want!

>Not really, you can only play with AI at this moment ...

In order to run this game, you are required to have the pygame library installed as well as your python installed.

[Download Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

Then, run this command in the terminal 

		$ python pong.py

This AI is currently very dumb or very smart (depends on your point of view). It can't miss any target, since the speed of the ball in y-direction is the exactly the speed of the AI in y-direction. I need to change the way the AI is done.

Scoring! This game currently got none, but will in the future!

Resetting! This game can't... for now, so you have to close the program and restart it every time...
